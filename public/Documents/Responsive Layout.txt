We used xampp as our local server because we cannot afford a public domain.

http://localhost/MindanaoDataExchange/MindanaoDataExchange.php 
This is the path for our php file.

We also used github for collaboration and file sharing.
Here is the link to our github where our php and images are located

Thank You ma'am!
